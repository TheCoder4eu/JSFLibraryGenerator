# JSFLibraryGenerator
A little XText project that's intended to make it simpler to create a JSF component library.

Creating a JSF library becomes - after a while - quite a repetive task. You have to maintain the taglib, you have to create the
component classes and you have to implement the renderer. Plus, the taglib doesn't read easily. Did I already mention the documentation pages?

The goal of this project is to generate these artifacts from a simple, legible and maintainable DSL language.

Let's see how it goes!
